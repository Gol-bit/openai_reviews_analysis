MOLLY MAID,Yelp,"Dec 24, 2024","I had scheduled an appointment for the service on dec 23, 2024 at 8:30-12:00. @12:10 and no staff show up at my place so I called the office to see what's going on and to found out that the staffs won't be able to come to my place for another 45 mins. So I wasn't happy having to waste half of my day to wait and no courtesy call to info that their staffs are coming late. It's ridiculous that if they come and you not home they charge you $100 and when they come late they don't even give you a call.

MOLLY MAID,Yelp,"Oct 29, 2024","I've regularly used Molly Maid in the past with generally acceptable results, despite occasional minor oversights, like not cleaning behind doors. Recently, however, I hired them for a move-out cleaning, and the experience was extremely disappointing.Today, I received an alarming and unprofessional call from one of their team members, accusing me of having ""chemicals"" on my countertops. She claimed there was ""fuming"" and smoke, which was allegedly making the staff feel unwell. When I asked what type of chemical she was referencing, she responded in a confrontational, almost aggressive manner, which was unsettling and unhelpful. The conversation escalated to the point where I felt compelled to escalate the issue to the manager, as the employee was agitated and unable to keep her composure.Neither my husband nor I have used any chemicals that could trigger this kind of reaction, so the unexpected call caused me to miss an important meeting, and my husband rushed home, fearing it was a genuine emergency.Additionally, upon the cleaners' arrival, they openly complained about the workload. Although this was a move-out cleaning, only two staff members were sent, whereas our regular cleanings typically require a team of four. This raised serious concerns about the level of service we could expect.While the manager was polite when I later called to express my concerns, the initial call was handled in an accusatory and unnecessarily confrontational manner. Not only was I blamed for something unsubstantiated, but I was left feeling unsettled, especially as we have children at home and consistently practice safe cleaning. Simple steps, like opening windows or wearing masks, could have mitigated any perceived issues, yet the staff took none of these precautions.This has been the most disruptive and disappointing experience I've had with Molly Maid. I would not use their services again, nor would I recommend them to you or anyone else.After returning home to check the work, the master bathroom, shower door was not cleaned. The house was not cleaned to normal standards, and they had said that they were going to send a quality person out, that obviously was not done. I didn't have very high hopes for this, considering they had terrible customer service earlier today. However, it ended up trickling down into a quality issue.They also scratched my appliances, leaving marks as if they used steel wool to clean, and you can see it here in the attached pictures. I called to escalate this to ownership and management, but I have still not received a call back. The purpose was to get my money back from my deposit for my move-out; this was supposed to help me. Now I am concerned I will not be getting the money back and will be now charged for the damaged appliances.",,,quality of cleaning;professionalism/service;efficiency/speed;specific issues,missed spots;poor attention to detail;unprofessional behavior;poor communication;slow service;damage to property;issues with specific areas of the house

They are prompt, very friendly and goes above and beyond.  They are also very friendly with my dog and my dog is so excited to see them.  The office is always accomodating and helpful.

MOLLY MAID,Yelp,"Aug 6, 2024","Molly Maid Review:   I have used the services of Mollly Maid for years and am pleased with the work that they do for me monthly.  They come regularly at the same time and date  and I can count on them in planning my schedule.     The company is very accommodating when I need to change the schedule and a replacement team is sent at my request, which I have done periodically when there is a conflict on the expected date.  Team 12 is my regular team. They and the replacement teams do a good job for us.    To vacuum, clean the baths and kitchen and dust are what we mainly request The maids  are very pleasant and efficient and I feel comfortable with having them take the responsibility of closing and locking up when they are done.  They are respectful of our home.  It is a treat to return to a clean and neat home after the maids leave.     Thank you, Molly Maids.

MOLLY MAID,Yelp,"Feb 16, 2024","We've been using Molly Maid for over a year now, and the quality hasn't been the greatest but it's been sufficient enough that we haven't pushed to find an alternative. However, recently we experienced a combination of rude behavior and inconsistent practices that pushed us to discontinue our service with them.Normally our cleaners wear shoe covers per our request (though I'm reading in previous reviews that this actually should be standard practice). Today we were sent a different cleaning team than we're used to and noticed the woman cleaning our bathroom was not wearing the shoe covers. We brought it up twice before they told us ""it was policy to not wear them in the bathroom"". I found that strange given we never had issues before. Furthermore, the explanation we were given when talking to the lead on the phone didn't make any sense. I understand safety in not wearing them in a tub where one might slip, but do not understand that logic being applied to the rest of the bathroom floor. How would wearing a shoe cover in our bathroom be any different than the rest of the hardwood floors in our home? Why would we want bacteria and dirt brought in from outside sullying our bathroom floors? Anyway, the main gripe is how rude the lead was in dismissing our concerns. She spoke disparagingly of me on the phone to one of the cleaners without realizing she was on speaker phone. Horrible way to treat your customers. Overall, cleaning is inconsistent, prices are not good value (and raised without any notice), and you're better off just cleaning yourself (which is what we ended up doing anyway).",,,quality of cleaning;professionalism/service;value/price,inconsistent cleaning;unprofessional behavior;poor communication;overpriced

MOLLY MAID,Yelp,"Feb 14, 2024","I have had Molly Maid come clean just my floors and bathrooms once a month for several months now. I remove everything off the floors (including chairs and small tables) before they come so they don't have to deal with working around them and can easily clean the floor and I lock my cats away so they don't have to worry about them escaping or being underfoot.Yesterday was the second time I've come home to find visible dirt (crumbs, pine needles) left on my rugs and floor and visible toothpaste left on a bathroom back splash. The first time this happened I finished sweeping and cleaning myself and went to cancel the service. They gave me a coupon to try them again and sent out a quality supervisor with the cleaning team the next time. They did a great job that month and the next month.Yesterday the team arrived to my house an hour early (I was just leaving for an in person meeting so I saw them arrive) and yet when I came home there were again visible pine needles left in a kitchen mat, visible crumbs left on the floor in three areas of the kitchen, and toothpaste on the bathroom backsplash.When I called about the problem Eileen apologized and said they would send someone out to re-clean the kitchen from 12 - 2 pm today (a window the team picked based on their schedule). I explained I could work from home in that window to let them in. At 2:05 pm no one had arrived nor contacted me so I called the office to ask if they were on their way. I spoke to Marissa who said she would call the team and get back to me on their eta. Instead of a call, I received a text back from Marissa saying the team was running behind and wouldn't get to my house until 3:30 pm (a full hour and half later than the window I was given). There was no apology or acknowledgment of how much later that time was nor questions about if I could accommodate that new time. Just the statement that they would now show up at 3:30 pm.Given the pattern of periodic poor cleaning I suspect this is an issue with how this branch of Molly Maid runs their business. If the cleaners are so rushed multiple times that they can't slow down enough to make sure bare floors are fully cleaned before they move on that is a big red flag.I would suggest taking your business elsewhere.

MOLLY MAID,Yelp,"Dec 21, 2023","Beware!!! It happened to me so don't let it happen to you.I had a gift certificate, so I thought I'd make use of Molly Maid of S. Silicon Valley for a move out service clean for a 1br 750 sq ft apartment. I was quoted at $185/hour for a team of 2. It sounds pricey but I figured I'd do all the cleaning I can (vacuum, dust, wipe down shelves, stove and fridge, and mop) ahead of time and let the professionals touch up so I get my full deposit back.I'd like to give people the benefit of the doubt so I wasn't there when they arrived at 8:20am. I didn't want to hover over them while they do their job. I thought I'd check in an hour later to see how things were progressing assuming they were close to done. I was surprised that they barely started - it didn't seem anything was done. Additionally, they didn't use shoe covers so they tracked in more dirt and the floor that I vacuumed and steam vac'd is now dirty. I didn't want to assume the worst so figured maybe I'll give them another hour. I come back at 10:20am and they are just starting on the windows. 2 hours, 2 professional cleaners, 750 sq ft in an empty apartment that I cleaned the day prior.I ask them how much longer it's going to take. They tell me until 12pm - that would be 4 hours, $740 for 2 people whose job it is to clean to clean a tiny, empty apartment. I ask them what they've been doing and one of the maid tells me that they were working on the fridge. But I cleaned the fridge!!! The day before, I took out each shelf and wiped them down, there's no way she had been cleaning the fridge. I had enough and tell them to get out.

Mind you I was supposed to get a call back for this said time change.  I never received a phone call back about my new time window, which I got over.  I did request a specific team because the very first visit with a different team a couple items went missing and I felt comfortable with my current team I been requesting and using.  I did explain this all to Miss Eileen durning my initial call.  Continuing on,  I did explain that the new time window is late and the reason for my change was because they called and was closed for the holiday.

The information regarding a minimum one hour charge for 2 cleaners was provided up front and that the cleaning staff will provide an estimate upon arrival after inspecting the area.  The cleaning staff provided  an estimate for their time based on 2 cleaners for 4-5.25 hours.  After 1.5 hours an additional cleaner showed up and worked just under 3 hours.

It still required the staff 4.5 hours and a charge well above the estimated higher dollar range of $560-$735, with a total bill of $829.  Normally if you provide a price quote to someone for work to be done by 2 people in 4.5 hours, only naturally the work should be completed in far less time with a 3rd worker.

Also they didn't mop the floor as part of the agreement yet one of the cleaners spent a good 10 mins on my toaster ; Huh?   That makes no sense.   Then she broke it. After speaking in broken english she spent another 10 mins calling her office to explain the situation in her language about the broken toaster - meanwhile I am being charged by the hour.

MOLLY MAID,Yelp,"Jun 16, 2022","**Edit**I have not been charged in a few days so I called back to see what was wrong. Not only did Claudia not explain the pricing properly, she incorrectly wrote my credit card down too. *******I should have done my due diligence and check reviews before booking an appointment. My cousin referred me to Moly Maid because she also uses them, but after my experience she is reconsidering.Time is really of the essence, but they have no sense of it. I scheduled my estimate consultation for 5PM on a Thursday. Claudia came 20-30 minutes late without giving any heads up. I decided to call the Molly Maid ""Contact Us"" number. In the midst of talking to the phone rep to see where Claudia was, I received an incoming call from her. I informed the rep that it must be her calling and the rep replies in a rude and snarky demeanor ""you should probably answer that"".Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I decide to schedule a cleaning session for the following week. I was informed it would be 150 an hour for the first visit. The duration would be dependent on whether I received 2 or 3 cleaners. Subsequent sessions would be 185 fixed price. Scheduling a slot had a huge 4 hour range, which makes it very hard to plan around the cleaning session.All I was told was the ""ladies"" would be coming somewhere between 12-4pm. On the day of, they arrived around 1pm. All of them had a language barrier so it was very hard to get any questions answered. Other services I had used before would notify me the day of when the cleaners would be coming. They also had a smaller scheduling window, allowing me to better plan my day. They also review pricing before starting the job. Molly Maid did none of this.I had a meeting so I closed my door for a bit. Upon finishing I told the ""ladies"" they could clean my office. I heard one of them say ""Pendejo"". Obviously without any context and the language barrier I can only assume that was directed to me. I decided to not cause any trouble so I let them proceed.After they finished my office they gave me the invoice which showed 1 hour and 50 minutes. The job only took 1 hour and 10 minutes. On top of this I was quoted a 225 per hour rate instead of the 150 like Claudia explained.Again, the language barrier prevented me from getting anything across to the ladies. I called Marissa (phone representative) to explain the dilemma. All things said, they still did a good job at cleaning so I stated that if they could honor the 150 an hour rate I'd be ready to schedule monthly cleanings for the fixed 185. She wanted to run it by her manager first.Maybe I don't know how to run a business, but the manager declined, which was essentially giving up a guaranteed 185 a month. That's 185 x 6 = 1110 they would be giving up for the remainder of the year. I guess the 80-100 dollar up front was more important to them than $1110. Anyway, I wouldn't waste my time with this company. Go for another company that is transparent and values your time. One that respects the customer and won't curse at them in their native tongue...If you look at another Yelp review below from 2 months ago. You can see he/she fell prey to their predatory style of pricing. He was not given the $150 an hr as quoted. Actually many reviews below mine have experienced this ""switch and bait"" tactic.

MOLLY MAID,Yelp,"May 4, 2022","I contacted Molly Maids for a quote online and was estimated at $300 to $400.  I felt that the quote was low and met with Marissa Jimenez who was very nice and received a new quote $360 to $720.  I called in for service for 3/22/2022.  I went by and inspected and the cleaning was not done.  I rescheduled for 04/28/2022 and received a call that day the cleaners would need more additional time and revised the costs to $900.  I stated I thought that the range had a not to exceed price of $720 since the estimator came through and looked at the entire property before the price was given. They said no it's based on how much time is needed.  We approved it since we did not want to have to find another cleaner to finish the job since we were going to put it on the market.I stopped by to inspect the home on 05/02/2022 and noticed the windows were not cleaned, debris on the floors, spider webs on the walls and ceilings, garage was not swept out.  For a job that went from a possible $360 to over $900 was a ""BAIT AND SWITCH"" knowing that we had no choice was not acceptable in my mind.  Knowing this was a house that needed more than just a simple cleaning, I specifically had them come in to do an in house estimate so they could see the work needed in detail.  I called and left a message with no call back left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  I feel if you quote a range and they could not do that work within the range, it is on your employees and not to come back to table with a new price.  I had photography set for the following day and had to clean all the windows myself before we put this home for sale.  So disappointing that Molly Maids charged approximately 3 times the regular price and the results didn't live up to your advertisements!",professionalism/service,friendliness,value/price;quality of cleaning;professionalism/service;efficiency/speed,overpriced;missed spots;poor communication;slow service

Those two didn't have a professional attitude either and they were very rude.Even after such a horrible job where we ended up cleaning the whole house after the left - they charged us around $ 500 for two hours.They also ripped us on pricing - they quoted $ 150/hour over the phone and didn't mentioned at all that their one time cleaning fee is high.Please see the attached pictures.",,,quality of cleaning;professionalism/service;value/price,inconsistent cleaning;poor attention to detail;unprofessional behavior;poor communication;overpriced;hidden fees

MOLLY MAID,Yelp,"Feb 22, 2022",We have been clients for a long time. Pleased with the work they do. I also like the fact that I can trust they don't judge for the way I cannot organize or clean my house by myself.,trustworthiness,reliability,,
MOLLY MAID,Yelp,"Feb 3, 2022","I'm editing the review in response to the owner's comment.  1. The original price was a system-generated number by the website. I made a reservation for a free estimate online but it ended up being a one-time clean reservation. I texted with the office to get it corrected.  2. Like I said, Claudia did not provide me a written quote of the price. She only said that the one-time cleaning will be hourly based with a team of two people at $125/h. Unfortunately I did not record our conversation so I don't have the proof.  3. I asked the management to limit the work to two hours after being notified that the rate was changed to $155/h. This is *after* the two ladies arrived and started working. As a matter of fact, Claudia and the management kept pushing me to accept the rate of $235+ for three-person cleaning. They put clients at a very tough position to refuse (the third lady was waiting outside, along with a fourth lady who was the driver).  4. I do not feel like this is the honest way of doing business. If the hourly charge is impacted by the number of people in the team, then the business should *NOT* change the number of people after the work has started and shovel the new rate down clients' throats.------------------------------------------------This is a copy of the email that I sent to the estimator with slight changes to improve readability as a review. 1. During our free estimate, Claudia informed me that one-time clean is always hourly based and the hourly rate is $125 for a team of two. She said that the job will take roughly 2.5 hours to 3 hours. She also informed me that regular cleaning will be $285 flat fee every time. I said I will consider after the initial clean. No formal written quote was provided -- which I regret deeply now given how the situation has changed. 2. The scheduled cleaning is in the afternoon. Two ladies showed up at 2 pm today after I called the office twice (once at 12:40 pm and was told that team will arrive in a hour or so, and once at 1:44 pm when no one showed up and the office had no idea where the team was). 3. Two more ladies showed up and I got confused. I then got on the phone with Claudia for a pronged conversation. She changed the quote to $155 per hour for a team of two and told me that Molly Maid never offers any flat fee arrangement. She also insisted on a team of three working at the house, which will lead to $230+ an hour. 4. I refused to have the team of three here as this is not what I agreed to or expected. I also requested the ladies to wrap up by two hours. I wore the email to her at the 1 hour and 20 min mark. So far the two ladies only finished one bathroom (working the second and barely starting the third one). 5. During the call she also mentioned that the ladies have another house to clean after mine. Again, I'd like to state that it's not my job to schedule the crew properly. Although it's a four hour window (12-4pm) for the team to show up, you can not expect them to show up at three and finish within an hour. Again, the ladies showed up at 2pm (I have footage with time stamp to show that). If they have another task after four, it's not on me to ensure that they have a manageable workload. 6. I chose Molly Maid because your service is assumed to be puncture and safe. It appears that the management has not done its job right.",,,professionalism/service;efficiency/speed;trustworthiness,poor communication;lack of responsiveness;slow service;unprofessional behavior;dishonesty

Merry Maids,Yelp,"Jun 13, 2022","I used Merry Maids for more than a year after I first moved to Arizona.  I found their hourly rate, $60 per maid, extreme.  Cleaning was adequate.  People doing the scheduling would screw things up and I would randomly end up with 'new' cleaners which is completely annoying.  Final straw, they raised their rate to $80 per hour. That is ridiculous.  Particularly after finding out MM only pay their maids approx $9-$15 per hour.  What the heck was the basis for the %20+ rate increase????   MM is ripping off the maids with that low wage and customers with an unwarranted, completely off the rails charge per hour.

I paid $315 for three hours of work and I was told by Merry Maids that I would not have to worry about it because everything would be completed.  It was not the employee's fault because she needed more time or another person to assist her....more time that she did not have. Merry Maids should have sent two people to work on this job.

She mixed the Endust with water and washed the floors with the dust mop. 2) Two items were broken (a candlestick and a picture frame).  Accidents happen and it would have been ok if I had been told.  Instead the 'deeds' were hidden.  I found the candle from the candlestick in a hiding spot (I'm giving the person the benefit of the doubt that it was broken and cleaned up rather than stolen).  I found the picture frame in pieces with the pieces carefully stuck together around the picture so I wouldn't notice.

Old review: I have cleanings every other week. It's nice to have a dependable service that cleans well. I have a lot of dog hair around the house and it gets cleaned up. I'm pretty messy, and they do a good job.
